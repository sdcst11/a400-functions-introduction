#python3
#example3, example3a, example3b and example3d go together to illustrate the point of using
# if__name__ == "__main__":

import example3
#you will notice that this program imports the entire file from example3.py and calls the function that executes the code to say "Hello world".  
#Importing the file imports all of the function definitions as well as any code that is not in a function
