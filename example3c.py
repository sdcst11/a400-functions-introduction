#python3
#example3, example3a, example3b and example3d go together to illustrate the point of using
# if__name__ == "__main__":

import example3
#you will notice that this program imports the entire file from example3.py but does not call the function. 
#That's because the function all is inside a conditional statement:
#
#if __name__ == "__main__":
#
# THIS program is the MAIN program, and the imported example3 is in the "example3" program.
